## 📝 Description

Threads web application, a social media platform that allows users to share their thoughts, with their friends and family. Threads is a full-stack web application built with TypeScript using Next.js 13 with Server Side Rendering. It uses MongoDB as a database, and Clerk as an authentication provider. It also uses UploadThing to upload images to the cloud. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components.

<details><summary><b>Dive into each folder and see what they contain</b></summary>

#### `app/`

`(auth)/` - `(root)/` - `(api)/`

In the app directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.

For example,

<img src="https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_5QyHJTqH6oRYZ4QJMFM7s3b9DHZZ" width="50%" />

#### `components/`

`atoms/` - `cards/` - `forms/` - `shared/` - `ui/`

The components directory contains all the components used in the application. The components are grouped into atoms, cards, forms, shared and ui.
the `ui` folder generated by `shadcn/ui` package and contains all the required shadcn components that used in the application.

#### `constants/`

`index.js`

This is a JavaScript code contains all the constants used in the application, specifically the Sidebar Navigation (`sidebarLinks`), Profile Tabs (`profileTabs`) and Community Tabs (`communityTabs`) constants.

#### `lib/`

`actions/` - `models/` - `validations/` - `mongoose.ts` - `uploadthing.ts` - `utils.ts`

The **lib** folder holds crucial components for _Threads App_:

- **actions**: Manage actions for Community, Thread, and User entities using Mongoose for database interaction.
- **models**: Define mongoose schemas for Community, Thread, and User entities.
- **validations**: Provide validation schemas with Zod for Thread and User data.
- **mongoose.ts**: Establishes and manages MongoDB connections for the application.
- **uploadthing.ts**: Offers a React utility for simplified file uploads to UploadThing.
- **utils.ts**: Contains various reusable utility functions.

#### `public/`

`assets/` - `next.svg` - `vercel.svg`

The public directory contains the media used in the application. The assets folder contains all the images used in the application.

## 🧰 Get Started

To get this project up and running in your development environment, follow these step-by-step instructions.

### 📋 Prerequisites

In order to install and run this project locally, you would need to have the following installed on your local machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### ⚙️ Installation and Run Locally

**Step 0:**

Note :bangbang: the application uses Clerk for Authentication and User Management, therefore, you need to create Clerk account [here](https://clerk.dev/) and sets the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in `.env` file. Also, the different URLs for the Clerk sign-in, sign-up, after sign-in and after sign-up pages.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a MongoDB database, therefore, you need to create a database and connect it to the application, for this, change the `MONGODB_URL` environment variable in `.env` file located in `server` folder.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a UploadThing Cloud, therefore, you need to create UploadThing account [here](https://uploadthing.com/) and sets the `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` environment variables in `.env` file.

After following all the instructions above, we'll want to create a new webhook on Clerk. To do this, go to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/), click on the "Webhooks" tab, and then click "Add Endpoint". For the Endpoint URL, enter `http://<PASTE-YOUR-LINK-HERE>/api/webhook/clerk`. For the evetnts, select the "organization", "organizationDomain", "organizationInvitation" and "organizationMembership". Then click "Create" to create the webhook. get the signing secret and set it as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in `.env` file.

**Step 1:**

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ladunjexa/nextjs13-threads.git
```

**Step 2:**

Execute the following command in the root directory of the downloaded repo in order to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3:**

Execute the following command in order to run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 4:**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 📜 Scripts

All scripts are defined in the `package.json` file. Here is a list of all scripts:

| Script          | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
| `npm run start` | Start your production site locally          |
| `npm run lint`  | Run ESLint                                  |

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Environment variables[^10] can be used for configuration. They must be set before running the app.

> [Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) are variables that are set in the operating system or shell, typically used to configure programs.

**Threads** uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/), and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) as external services. You need to create an account on each of these services and get the required credentials to run the app.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<CLERK_SECRET_KEY>
NEXT_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET>

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/onboarding
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

MONGODB_URL=<MONGODB_URL>

UPLOADTHING_SECRET=<UPLOADTHING_SECRET>
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=<UPLOADTHING_APP_ID>
```
